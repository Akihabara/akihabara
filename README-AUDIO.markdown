Akihabara Audio
===============

* Make sure that you're using the latest version of your browser before using audio features.
* Firefox stable has little audio caching problem/slowdowns and sometime freezes - can't figure out if is plugin's fault. Seems fixed on nightly builds. Audio is not marked as experimental.
* For compatibility with Safari, every audio file used for games MUST be more than 1.5 seconds long. Add silence to reach the 1.5secs length.
* Safari is having troubles on downloading audio for unknown reasons. Seems fixed on nightly builds. For now AUDIO IS EXPERIMENTAL.
